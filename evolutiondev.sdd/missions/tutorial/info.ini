; To link single player mission to lobby you need to follow directions below:
; 1. Create "missions" folder in lobby folder ( where lobby application is located )
; 2. In "missions" folder make a folder with your game ( example: NOTA )
; 3. In "YOUR_GAME_FOLDER" folder make a MISSION_FILE_NAME.ini ( example: 001.ini )
; 4. Fill in all the values in MISSION_FILE_NAME.ini ( Depends, About )
; 5. If mission started with predefined script ( Zero-K mission editor ) that script should be renamed to start_script.txt and placed in mission directory
;
; P.S.: Mission's description maybe in RichText HTML format: http://qt-project.org/doc/qt-4.8/richtext-html-subset.html
